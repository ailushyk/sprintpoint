# Easy Poker

## Description

The Planning Poker app is a user-friendly and efficient tool for estimating
project scope. It saves time by eliminating lengthy discussions and debates
among team members. The app enables team members to cast their votes
simultaneously and anonymously, and then reveal their votes together. This
anonymity allows everyone to express their opinions freely without fear of
judgment. Additionally, the app allows teams to track project progress and make
adjustments to their plan as needed, helping them stay on track with their goals
and deadlines. Overall, the Planning Poker app is an essential tool for agile
teams looking to streamline their work process and ensure successful project
completion.
